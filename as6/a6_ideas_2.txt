int array of player skills

long long int total_excitement initialized to 0 in main

// this could return the victor of the sub tree
int tree_traversal ( root ) {
    if ( the tree is empty )
        victor is the next unused player in our array of players
        return the skill of that player

    if two players compete against each other
        update the total_excitement by their skill difference

    You don't need to store the victor in the root
    return the victor's skill instead
}

// this could return a node that represents the victor and more
Node tree_traversal ( root ) {
    if ( the tree is empty )
        create this node assign the victor as the next unused player
        assign the total excitement of the sub-tree as 0
        return the node

    as your doing the traversal
    you assign the right child to the tree_traversal of the right child
    you assign the left child to the tree_traversal of the left child
}
